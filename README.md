# Materials Science First Year Viscometer Project 

## About the project 
As a team of 10 imnovative minds from Imperial College London, Imnovation is proud to finally 
present you the groundbreaking project: the “Imnometer.” Fluid mechanics is one of the most important 
concepts in the science world and has lots of uses in our daily lives, but the two machines generally used, 
viscometers and rheometers, can be hard to get a hand on. Our team is here to solve this by introducing the 
Imnometer, a cheap, portable, precise and accurate viscometer alternative that is going to leave its mark in 
the academia. We have tried to approach the problem of inaccessibility to viscometers with great care and 
creativity, hoping to bring you the best project possible. 

To briefly explain our thought process, we first examined the different types of rheometers and 
viscometers. We saw that rheometers are much more advanced and can control and measure a wider range 
of parameters; however, they are also significantly more expensive. Viscometers on the other hand, measure 
properties with much less characterization. Their main advantage is that it allows portability to some extent.
[1] As a team, we are aiming to increase the portability to help with remote testing and experiments while 
still being as accurate and precise as a regular viscometer. 

There are types of viscometers as well. Since we pursued a versatile rheology device, we have
successfully implemented the Imnometer to switch between 3 of the most used rotational types: parallel 
plates, cone-and-plate and bob-and-cup viscometers. To achieve this, our viscometer has interchangeable 
parts to change between the three types. Parallel plate viscometers are the most precise type of rotational 
viscometers; however, they are sensitive, making it hard to have accurate reading in some cases. For the 
second type, cone-and-plate, they are precise while being less sensitive; however, they have the tendency 
to wear out easier and are usually better for non-Newtonian fluids. So, our viscometer will be able to work 
with all fluids, while also allowing the user to make changes within the device to have better measurement.

Our viscometer’s circuit is connected to an Arduino Uno powered up by a computer. But the most 
important element in the circuit is the Nextion touch screen that is being used. Through it, the user will be 
able to select the mechanism being used, and will be able to see both the final graph and the viscosity value 
on the screen. The screen is also perfectly compatible with the Arduino Uno inside, making it easy to work 
with. In general, it will be extremely convenient to take the measurements.

Although our innovative vision and the Imnometer’s versatility and affordability will set us apart 
from the competitors, another thing we value greatly is aesthetics. The design resembles a box, following 
a minimalistic approach. This design also allows easier portability and maintenance. The Imnometer is 
mostly transparent, making it even more minimalistic. The transparency also provides some practicality by 
allowing the mechanisms to be observed while the measurements are being taken. The top part of the design 
will be coloured purple to both give it a more refreshing look and to represent our company’s signature 
colour: purple. It will prevent all the circuitry to be seen, making it more pleasant to look at.

Also to briefly talk about the materials used in the design, 5mm clear cast acrylic was used for the 
box and PLA was used for the components. Although they may not be the most environmentally materials, 
they boost the affordability aspect of the product and are still recyclable. More information about this can 
be found later on in the sustainability report.

All in all, Imnovation has brought a device ready to change the science world. The impossible 
combination of affordability, accuracy, precision, aesthetics and portability have been made true in this 
revolutionary project. The 10 bright minds working in the team are more than pleased to present the final 
version of our project and are looking forward to start mass producing the device, hoping that every school 
or college will be able to access this device to educate the youth and help develop imnovative minds.
